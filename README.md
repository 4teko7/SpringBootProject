# SpringBootProject

<p>
  <i>
  In this project, I will develop a sprinboot application without springframework features. This means that I will write code without jpa @Autowired @Repository @Service etc. annotations. I will create queries and classes myself. In a sort, there will be no shortcut, everything will be coded. After this project I will also write another springboot application but in this project , many features of springframework will be used including AOP, JPA, Many Annotations etc. and the most important news about this project, The Microservices will be used.
